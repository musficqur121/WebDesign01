<h1><b style="color: black;">Must-visit places in Tibet</b></h1>
<p>To travel to Tibet and experience the grandeur of the Potala Palace from a close distance must be the desire of many people. Apart from the Potala Palace, there are many other places in Lhasa that are worth visiting, such as the Dazhaosi Temple, which is not far away from the Potala Palace. Also not to be missed is Namtso, the second largest lake in Tibet.</p>

<h1><b style="color: red;">Potala Palace</b></h1>
<p>When it comes to Tibet, people always think of the magnificent palace on Marpori (Red Mountain) in the north-western side of Lhasa – the Potala Palace.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the seventh century, Songtsen Gampo unified Tibet and established the Tibetan Empire. The emperor built approximately 1,000 palace houses in different scales on Red Mountain and named the place “Potala” which refers to the residence of Guanyin in Buddhist texts. More than 200 years later, the Tibetan Empire fell, and the Potala Palace was almost completely destroyed with only two Buddhist temples remained.</p>
<p>Not until the 17th century did Lhasa become the political centre of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau again. The Potala Palace was reconstructed and continuously expanded. The “White Palace” (PotrangKarpo) for all generations of the Dalai Lama, “Red Palace” (PotrangMarpo) consisting of the palaces that contain the tombs of the Dalai Lamas and other Buddhist temples, corridors and gardens were built during this period.</p>
<p>Starting from the fifth Dalai Lama, all the Dalai Lamas have resided in the Potala Palace. Important religious and political ceremonies were held in the palace, making the venue the centre of Tibetan caesaropapism. The grand Potala Palace, built on the hill, exhibits the distinctive Tibetan Buddhist and Tibetan architectural styles. The exterior of the palace was painted in red, white and yellow which represent solemnity, tranquillity and completion respectively.</p>
<h1><b style="color: red;">Jokhang</b></h1>
<video src="/travel02.mp4" controls width="900px" height="600px"></video>
<p>The Jokhang is the "spiritual heart" of Lhasa and the supreme sanctuary of Tibetan Buddhism. After Songtsen Gampo established the Tibetan Kingdom, the dynasty prospered. Then, there were marriages of state between him and Princess Wencheng of the Tang dynasty and Princess Bhrikuti Devi of Licchavi. It is said that the Jokhang is dedicated to the several Buddha statues brought by the two princesses from their homelands.</p>
<p>Princess Wencheng brought an image of 12-year-old Shakyamuni Buddha and Princess Bhrikuti brought a wooden Buddha statue. The two statues are still being worshipped in the Jokhang. According to Buddhist legends, when Songtsen Gampo died, his soul became a beam of light and entered the wooden statue.</p>
<p>During the Cultural Revolution, the Jokhang could not escape from destruction. Many Buddha statues were destroyed. The temple even became a pig slaughterhouse. It was highly disrespectful as Tibetan Buddhism strictly prohibits monks and nuns from slaughtering for satisfying their desire for meat.</p>
